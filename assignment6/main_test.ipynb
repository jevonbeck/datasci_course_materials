         "source":"***Midday Crime Spikes in Cities***\n\n**Project Objectives**\n\nThis analysis identifies when major crimes across Seattle and San Francisco were committed during the Summer 2014 period and outlines the nature of observed midday crime spikes. More details about the project objectives and data set can be found at https://github.com/uwescience/datasci_course_materials/blob/master/assignment6/crimeanalytics.md\n\n\n**General Approach**\n\nThe data from each city was first normalised to facilitate easier comparison. The 5 most prominent crimes for each city was then determined and used as the basis of comparison across the cities. The data was then grouped by city, crime type and time occurence to perform analyses.\n\n\n**Implementation**\n\nData Normalisation predominantly involved converting Seattle data to the San Francisco format since the San Francisco format was better broken down by incident time and had fewer crime categories. Category mapping was also performed against the top 10 categories in each city, with ambiguous prominent categories not being mapped on a per-city basis. The top 5 categories were then extracted and grouped by city, crime type and time occurence.\n"

For example, Property Damage is more dominant in Seattle than in San Francisco. It is difficult, however, to make converse statements about San Francisco since \"Non-Criminal\" and \"Other Offences\" categories are too ambiguous to single out as prominent activities.\n\nHaving identified the types of crimes taking place, understanding when they occur can be helpful in prevention. As there are many facets of time, it may be important to look at activity on specific days and/or times of day to gain insights. The Incident by the Time of day graphs for each day of the week is plotted for each city for comparison.\n"

The intuitive pattern of reduced activity just after the early hours of the morning, is met with the slightly alarming rise and maintainence of activity throughout the rest of the day.\n\nA more curious insight, however, is a noticeable spike in activity around 12pm and 1pm (hour 12) that goes down slightly afterwards.
