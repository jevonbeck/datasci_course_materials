problem 1: Run example.pig with btc-2010-chunk-000 on 10 small nodes.
How many records are there in count_by_object?

----
problem 2a: Using the 'cse344-test-file' file,
write a Pig script that groups tuples by the subject column,
and creates/stores histogram data showing the distribution of counts per subject,
then generate a scatter-plot of this histogram
(2nd batching operation, x-axis: subject-counts, y-axis: number of subjects associated with subject-count,
i.e. no. of subjects that have the same count).

How many (x, y) points are generated in the histogram? 

----
problem 2b:Now run your script from Problem 2A on 'btc-2010-chunk-000' file. Please use a 5-node cluster of small instances (21 min operation).

How many (x, y) points are generated in the histogram?

----
problem 3:

How many records are generated by the join for the cse-344-test-file dataset? For the btc-2010-chunk-000 dataset?
